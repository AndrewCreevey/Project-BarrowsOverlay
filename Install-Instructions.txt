Here's some instructions/info to help reduce errors :)

######################################################################

First step: Install the runescape font in the Barrows folder!
Simply double click, then click "install" in the top left, then exit

######################################################################

For stream, you will have to window capture the overlay when its open
then drag/resize to fit over the chatbox

At the moment you can't reduce the number of barrows items, so if 
you accidentally click one you will have to restart the program :P
	- I can fix this if you really like, just let me know
	  if it becomes an annoying issue, its quite a big job for me

######################################################################

I thought the chest would be most annoying when you have >100 chests
so, you can right click on the chest and change the number

From then on, especially when you have high numbers (1000+) you have 
to click the very top of the box to add to count/right click.
