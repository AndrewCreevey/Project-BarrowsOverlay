This was an overlay I made for a YouTuber/Live Streamer, Finn, who has over 15,000 subscribers.

While live streaming his progress, he was regularly asked what items he had obtained so far, how many of X item, how many chests opened. Previously he had a very bland picture with the 24 items on which he was updating every time he got an item. To update his overlay he had to; email his friend what item he obtained, his friend had to edit his photoshop file and email it back to Finn. I saw an opportunity where I could combine my programming knowledge and my creativity to try and make an interactive program that looked great and was easy to use. 

Finn was stoked when he saw what I created and has directed a few people my way, who want their own overlays. This has led to more opportunities for me to hone my skills and create many other overlays. Currently I am making a second overlay for finn to use at the end of each video.
