# Barrows Overlay

This was an overlay I made for a YouTuber/Live Streamer, Skourai_RS, who has over 15,000 subscribers.

Previously he had a very bland picture with the 24 items on which he was updating every time he got an item. To update his overlay he had to; email his friend what item he obtained, his friend had to edit his photoshop file and email it back to Finn.

I saw an opportunity where I could combine my programming knowledge and my creativity to try and make an interactive program that looked great and easy to use. 

Finn was stoked when he saw what I created and has directed a few people, who want their own overlays, my way. This has led to more opportunities for me to hone my skills and create many other overlays.

Follow my progress with other overlay projects on GitHub :)
